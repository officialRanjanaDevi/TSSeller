        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          We recommend you review the legal and policies section in the Supplier
          Panel to ensure your uploaded catalogues are in compliance with the
          policies of Trianshopy.
        </p>

          What Is A Catalog?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          A catalog is basically the list of products that you want to sell. You
          can upload a single catalog or you can upload catalogs in bulk using a
          CSV (excel) file. Within each catalog, you can have a minimum of 1
          product and a maximum of 9 products of the same category that you want
          to sell.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          For example, you want to sell 6 sarees, then within the same catalog,
          you can upload all the 6 products together. But if you want to sell 1
          saree and 1 kurta, you will have to upload a different catalog for
          each category.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          It is now very easy to upload single catalogs or bulk catalogs on
          Trianshopy! The product catalog gets live post 72 hours from the time
          of upload.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          While uploading a catalog, you will have to select a category first
          and then upload the product images. Uploading more than one image for
          your product is recommended to give the customers a better view of
          your product. The detailed image guidelines will be provided in the
          Trianshopy Supplier panel. For each product, you will have to then
          fill in details like the Price, GST, etc.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          It is recommended that you create a catalog with at least 3-4 products
          to increase the chances of getting an order. We also recommend
          uploading at least 5-7 catalogs in the first few days to get better
          visibility.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          We recommend you review the legal and policies section in the Supplier
          Panel to ensure your uploaded catalogues are in compliance with the
          policies of Trianshopy.
